<p>  Northern Samar is a province in the Philippines located in the Eastern Visayas region. Its capital is
Catarman and is located at the northern portion of the island of Samar. Bordering the province to the south
are the provinces of Samar and Eastern Samar.</p>
<p>  Northern Samar has several tourism potentials that remain undiscovered by tourists. Some of these include
old churches, waterfalls, rivers, caves, virgin forests, and beaches.</p>
<p>  Among the last frontiers in the country, its rugged coastline of limestone cliffs along the Pacific Ocean
is a historical landmark. During the Spanish Colonial Era, Samar island was the first Philippine landfall seen
by the Manila galleons as they approached the end of their long voyage from Acapulco.</p>
<p>  Entering the waters of the Philippine archipelago, the galleons called at the fortified island of Capul off
Samar' offered thanks for a safe crossing at the Jesuit church, and then negotiated the rough waters of narrow San
Bernardino Strait toward Manila, their final destination. </p>
<p>  Capul also became the last stop on Philippine soil of departing galleons before the long, often trecherous
trans-Pacific sail to Acapulco in Mexico.</p>
