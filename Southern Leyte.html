<p> Southern Leyte is a province in the Philippines located in the Eastern Visayas region.
Its capital is the city of Maasin. Southern Leyte was a sub-province of Leyte until it was
made into an independent province. Southern Leyte includes Limasawa, an island to the south
where the first Roman Catholic Mass in Philippine soil is believed to have taken place and
thus considered to be the birthplace of Roman Catholicism in the Philippines.</p>
<p> Southern Leyte's geological features created several issues in the province after the
flooding of the Subangdaku River and the 2006 mudslide in Guinsaugon. Organizations warned
province it was susceptible to natural occurences like landslides and floods.</p>
<p> Southern Leyte forms an important part of the inter-island trabsportation system of the
country, with ferries transporting people and goods between Liloan and Surigao del Norte in
Mindanao. The province is well known for its quality abaca products and is the country's major
producer of abaca fiber.</p>
