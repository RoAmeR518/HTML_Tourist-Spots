<center><h1>Metropolitan Cathedral of<br><center>Our Lord's Transfiguration<center></h1><center>
<p> The Metropolitan Cathedral of Our Lord's Transfiguration, also known as
Palo Metropolitan Cathedral or simply Palo Cathedral, is a Roman Catholic church
located at Palo, Leyte in the Philippines belonging to the Vicariate of Palo
under the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Palo.</p>
<h1>Monte Cueva<br>(Maasin, Southern Leyte)</h1>
<p> Monte Cueva shrine is a place that is well-known for the Marian devotees.
This place has been a must-see place for the devotees and the pilgrims. As for
its origin, it all started with a dream. The owner of the land who happens to be a lawyer,
Joaquin Chung Jr., dreamt of the Lady of the Assumption asking him to put up a shrine
in that specific area. He believed in his dream, and so he right away built the
church and eventually gave it to the ownership and management of the Diocese.</p>
<h1>Sambawan Island</h1>
<p> Sambawan Island is Biliran's answer to paradise. White sands, thriving marine life
and warm blue waters lapping up the tree-lined shore is a must for those wanting to
escape from reality. Sambawan Island is located 5km of the west coast of Maripipi
Municipality, south of the Samar sea, is fast becoming the most visited attraction by
the tourists. The semi-curved beach with soaring rock formations covered with green
grass as a backdrop create a bubble of fantasy that you are entering another dimension.</p>
<h1>Bangon falls</h1>
<p> This is a must go to place if you are in Calbayog. The trip to the falls require taking
a ride on a motor bike called locally as a Habal-Habal. Its about 3 km of rough and bumpy
rock like terrain. Then you walk along the river bed to the three layer waterfalls and can
even climb all the way up to the top lake and take a swim. This should be done on the summer
months so the climb is not to difficult or the cascades too strong.</p>
<h1>San Bernardino Strait</h1>
<p> The San Bernardino Strait is a strait in the Philippines, connecting the Samar Sea with
the Philippine Sea. It separates the Bicol Peninsula of Luzon island from the island of Samar
in the south.</p>
<h1>Tubabao</h1>
<p> Tubabao is an island off the southeastern point of Samar island. It is one of the islands
comprising the town of Guiuan in the province of Eastern samar, in east central Philippines.</p>
