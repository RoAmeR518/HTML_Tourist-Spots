<p> Biliran is an island province in the Philippines located in the Eastern Visayas region
(Region VIII). Biliran is one of the country's smallest and newest provinces. Formerly a
sub-province of Leyte, it became an independent province in 1992.</p>
<p> Biliran lies less than a kilometer north of the island of Leyte. A bridge-causeway fixed
over Poro Island connects the province to Leyte. Its capital is the municipality of Naval
on the western coast of the island.</p>
<p> During the early Spanish era, what is now called Biliran was known as Isla de Panamao.
The present name, believed to be adopted sometime between the late 17th century and the early
18th century, was, according to many publications, derived from a native grass called
<i>borobiliran</i> which once grew abundantly on the island's plains. A contending theory
states that the name came from the word <i>bilir</i>, which was defined in old Visayan
dictionary to be the "corner or edge of a boat, vase or anything protruding, like veins, 
or the furrow made by the plow." The dictioary also gives <i>biliran</i> as an alternate
spelling for <i>bilir</i>. This theory is supported by the fact that Biliran was site of the
first large-scale shipyard, built in the 17th century. Galleons were built to support the Galleon
trade between Manila and Acapulco in Mexico.</p>
