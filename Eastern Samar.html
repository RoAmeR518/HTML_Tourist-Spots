<p> Eastern Samar is a province in the Philippines located in the Eastern Visayas region.
Its capital is the city of Borongan. Eastern Samar occupies the eastern portion of the
island of Samar. Bordering the province to the north is the province of Northern Samar
and to the west is Samar province. To the east lies the Philippine Sea, part of the vast
Pacific Ocean, while to the south lies the Leyte Gulf.</p>
<p> During his circumnavigation of the globe, Ferdinand Magellan had set foot on the tiny
island of Homonhon in the southern part of the province. On March 16, 1521, the area of
what is now Eastern Samar is said to be the first Philippine landmass spotted by Magellan
and his crew.</p>
<p> On September 28,1901 during the Philippine-American War, Filipino guerrillas in Balangiga
ambushed American troops, killing 48 members of the US 9th Infantry. The incident triggered
the infamous American retaliation against the Samar populace and gurrillas.</p>
<p> During the Second World War in 1944, combined Filipino-American troops involved in the
liberation of the Philippines from Japan built in the town of Guiuan the largest military
base in the Pacific. In the same town in 1949, approximately 5,000 Russian refugees escaping
from communist China temporarily settled on Tubabao Island until 1951, when they were
transferred to Australia and the United States.</p>
