<p>  Samar, formerly named as Western Samar, is a province in the Philippines located on Samar Island
in Eastern Visayas. Its capital is Catbalogan City. It is bordered by Northern Samar, Eastern Samar, Leyte
and the Leyte Gulf, and includes several islands in the Samar Sea. Samar is connectedd to the island of
Leyte via the San Juanico Bridge. </p>
<p>  In 1768, Leyte and modern Samar was created out of the historical province of Samar. In 1965, Northern
and Eastern Samar were created. Fishing and agriculture are the major economic activities in the province.
On November 8, 2013, the province was significantly damaged by Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), particularly at the
towns of Basey and Marabut. </p>
<p>  Samar is said to  be derived from <i>Samad</i>, the Visayan word for "wound" or "cut", describing the
rough physical features of the land which is rugged and deeply dissected by streams. </p>
